# WhileChallenge - 09/01/18

A number guessing game that uses while loops. The user is asked to set a number they want to guess up to. They then have 10 guesses to find the correct number. They have the option of quitting the game by entering 0.

# ListChallenge - 09/01/18

Created a blank menu, followed by appending the menu with various meal lists. Code was then written to find a meal that doesn't contain spam and print out the items in the list individually.
